2.3.1
	[#]Fixed launch parameter.
	[#]Fixed failsafes not working.
	[*]Using Runspaces now for failsafes. Luckily Powershell kills all runspaces when the main thread is closed...

2.3.0 - reboot
	[*]Complete rewrite.
	[+]Now comes with (and requires) a module for controlling all SK stuff.
	[+]Can now temporarily elevate itself with -SK_AsAdmin, even when the service was already runnning. In this mode the console needs to be kept open when the service was already running until the started app exited to restart the service with normal privileges.
	[-]No -SK_LegacyWait and -SK_Wait anymore.
	[+]This is now handled by SK and set with -SK_AutoStop <Injected | Exit>. With -SK_AutoStop Exit the console needs to be kept open until the started app exited, so it can actually stop the service.

2.2.2 (Never released)
	[#]Fixed whitelist encoding again, since SK changed. It is now UTF8.
	[*]Now always trys to whitelist the app folder.

2.2.1 (This version was mistakenly labeled as 3.3.0)
	[*]Doesn't ask anymore, when service is already running. Assumes it should not be stopped.
	[+]-SK_InjectOther <absolute path> to wait for this app to be injected instead (and whitelisted, if -SK_Whitelist is also given.)
	[+]Ignores -Whitelist, if path contains \steamapps\, as this is already whitelisted by default.

2.2.0
	[+]Short therm global injection: Only runs Special K's service until it successfully injected itself in the started app (or times out after 1 minute).
	[*]Uses short therm global injection as default now. To switch to the old behavior use -SK_LegacyWait.
	[+]You can also use -SK_Wait <seconds> to wait a fixed amount of time before stopping the service, without any checks.

2.1.2
	[+]Now shows its name and version on startup.
	[+]Uses standalone host process for Special K from SKIF, when found.
	[*]Internal changes. Now uses event based shutdown for SK.
	[*]Changed names of all parameters, so it is less likely colliding with launch options for the defined app. Please refer to the internal help.

2.1.1
	[#]Fixes whitelist encoding issues. Whitelist is now saved in your systems codepage instead of ASCII.

2.1.0
	[*]Now searches SK in actual Windows Documents folder, even if not in default location. Thanks again Aemony.
	[+]Implemented help. Run without any parameter to read.
	[+]EXPERIMENTAL: Automatic whitelisting with parameter -Whitelist. Needs testing. Backup you whitelist, just in case.

2.0.1
	[+]Waits for SK to be ready before starting the defined app.

2.0.0
	[*]Rewrite in PowerShell 5.1
	[*]The Batch file is now only a wrapper that starts a PowerShell script (*.ps1) with the same name as the Batch (*.bat).
	[+]Supports launchers and restarts (via SK or app itself). Keeps global injection running while any child processes of the started app are running.

1.0.1
	[*]Initial Batch Version
	[*]Inspired by @Xuru#0294's question on Special K's Discord
